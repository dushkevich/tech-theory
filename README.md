Hello, friend! 
You are reading my devops notes, here I will think out loud about my journey, about best (on my opinion) architecture, technologies that I use and my projects.

Make a note of something, [[continuous_integration_&_de]], or try [the Importer](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Importer)!

When you're ready, delete this note and make the vault your own.
